The intellectual property (IP) and ownership of "ALL IN ONE" in its entirety belongs solely to me, Amirmahdi Rezaei. However, I will not claim ownership over the intellectual property of independent projects that operate under the umbrella of "ALL IN ONE".

I do, however, retain the right to use their work without granting them any ownership rights. This is similar to how projects under "ALL IN ONE" have used "ALL IN ONE's" resources and facilities without transferring their project's IP to "ALL IN ONE". They have not assigned their project's IP to "ALL IN ONE".

Projects that operate under the "ALL IN ONE" umbrella and have used "ALL IN ONE's" modules and resources can retain the intellectual property of their own project. However, if they develop any modules, those will fall under the intellectual property of "ALL IN ONE".

"ALL IN ONE" can use all projects and all modules developed by these projects without having to share the "ALL IN ONE" intellectual property with anyone. Conversely, all teams under "ALL IN ONE" can also use the modules developed by other teams and the modules provided to them by "ALL IN ONE", without having to share the intellectual property of their own project with anyone.
