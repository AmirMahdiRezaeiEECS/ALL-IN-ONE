## **Project Description: “ALL IN ONE Projects”**


We are several teams of AI engineers who aim to build multiple artificial intelligence models.

Our goal is to **unite teams** that can collaborate with **maximum independence** and **minimum dependency** possible.

This independence will enhance the teams’ **speed, agility, creativity, and initiative**.

At the same time, the teams must remain **united** and **work in close cooperation**.

But how can we give each team such high independence while still keeping them united and aligned toward a common goal ? My idea to solve this challenge is to **combine Steve Jobs’s leadership style** with **modern software development strategies**.

We will achieve this through **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **modular programming**, and the principles of **SOLID**.

I haven’t yet decided on the exact technical details — and I need your help and consultation for that.

Our plan is to **divide the project into smaller, well-defined sections**, so that each team focuses on its own responsibilities without getting entangled in the complexities of other parts, while still understanding the overall structure and maintaining close coordination with others.

Overall, our method follows **Steve Jobs’s philosophy**, and our main goal — under the strategy we call **“ALL IN ONE”** — is to **unite the teams**.

**These Steve Jobs speeches are extremely important : **

> [!important] Steve Jobs : 
> one of the keys to apple is apple's an incredibly collaborative company and so you know how many committees we have at apple no zero we have no committees no committees we are a ver we are organized like a startup one person is in charge of iphone os software one person is in charge of mac hardware one person is in charge of iphone hardware engineering another person is in charge of worldwide marketing another person is in charge of operations it's we're organized like a startup we're the biggest startup on the planet and we all meet for three hours once a week and we talk about everything we're doing the whole business and there's tremendous teamwork at the top of the company which filters down to tremendous teamwork throughout the company and teamwork is dependent on trusting the other folks to come through with their part without watching them all the time but trusting that they're going to come through with their parts and that's what we do really well and we're great at figuring out how to divide things up into these great teams that we have and all work on the same thing touch bases frequently and bring it all together into a product we do that really well and so what i do all day is meet with teams of people and work on ideas and solve problems to make new products to make new marketing programs whatever it is and are people willing to tell you you're wrong yeah i mean other than snarky journalists i mean people are working yeah no we have wonderful arguments and do you win them all or oh no i wish i did i'll see you can't if you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you you have to let them make a lot of decisions and you have to you have to be run by ideas not hierarchy the best ideas have to win so otherwise good people don't stay but you must be more than a facilitator who runs meetings you obviously contribute your own ideas i contribute ideas sure why would i be there if i didn't

> [!important] Steve Jobs : 
> I've never believed in the theory that if we're on the same management team and a decision has to be made and I decide in a way that you don't like and I say come on buy into the decision like we're all on the same team you don't agree but buy into it let's go make it happen because what happens is sooner or later you're paying somebody to do what they think is right but then you're trying to get them to do what they think isn't right and it it and sooner or later it outs and and you you end up having that conflict. So, I've always felt the best way is to get everybody in a room and talk it through until you agree. Now, that's not everybody in the company, but that's everybody that's really involved in that decision that needs to to execute it. We're paying people to tell us what to do. Other words, I don't view that we pay people to do things. That's easy to find people to do things. What's harder is to find people to tell you what should be done. Maybe there's once or twice, but I I can't even recall a time when I've said, "Damn it, I'm the CEO and we're doing it this way." You know, I can recall a time when I've said, "We don't see eye to eye and you're off the team." You know, I've had to say that once or twice over a prolonged period of time when a person has not wanted to go in the same direction we've wanted to go in as a team. It's my job every once in a while to say, "Hey, you want to go this way? We want to go this way." It's not working. But uh when people are on the team then we work it 

My other role models are **Jensen Huang** and **Elon Musk** :

> Fast forward just a little bit to the NVIDIA of today — so how large is your leadership team?

> 
> **[Jensen Huang]:**  
> Yeah, they all report to me — 60 direct reports.

> **[Interviewer]:**

> 60 direct reports — which is not conventionally considered a best practice.
> 
> **[Jensen Huang]:**  
> 
> I agree that it’s not conventional, but I’m certain it’s the best practice.  
> By the end of this, I’m going to convince all of you to have 60 people on your direct reports.
> 
> The reason — first of all — is because the layer of hierarchy in your company really matters.  
> Information really matters.  
> I believe that your contribution to the work should not be based on privileged access to information.
> 
> I don’t do one-on-ones.  
> My staff is quite large, and almost everything that I say, I say to everybody all at the same time.  
> The reason for that is because I don’t really believe there’s any information that I operate on that somehow only one or two people should hear about.
> 
> These are the challenges of the company, or the problems I’m trying to solve, or the directions we’re going into.  
> These are the new endeavors — this isn’t working, that’s working well.  
> All of this type of information — everybody should be able to hear.
> 
> I love that everybody’s working off of the same song sheet.  
> I love that there’s no privileged access to information.  
> I love that we’re all able to contribute to solving a problem.
> 
> When you have 60 people in a room — and oftentimes, my staff meetings are once every other week — it’s all based on issues.  
> Whatever issues we have, everybody’s there working on it at the same time.  
> Everybody heard the reasoning of the problem, everybody heard the reasoning of the solution, everybody heard everything.
> 
> That empowers people.  
> I believe that when you give everybody equal access to information, it empowers people.

> Number two — if the CEO’s direct staff is 60 people, the number of layers you’ve removed in a company is probably something like seven, depending on how it’s structured.
> 
> **[Interviewer]:**  
> Is it 60 at every layer, or only 60 as in like — if I’m one of the fortunate 60, do I also have 60 direct reports?
> 
> **[Jensen Huang]:**  
> No. I don’t think that’s scalable downward.  
> You need more and more supervision depending on the level.

> Do you not do those things, or do you do them in a different way?

> You created the conditions, but we should all learn from it. Does that make sense?

> [!important] Elon Musk : 
> I think there I do think there's a good a good framework for thinking is physics you know the sort of first principles reasoning I mean generally that I think there are um what I mean by that is uh boil things down to the the fundamental truths and reason up from there as opposed to reasoning by analogy um through most of our life we we get through life by reasoning by analogy which essentially means kind of coughing what other people do with slight variations um and you have to do that otherwise it's it's mentally you wouldn't be able to get through the day um but when you when you want to do something new you you have to you have to apply the the physics approach get physics is really sort of figured out how to discover new things that are counterintuitive like quantum mechanics it's really counter-intuitive so I think I think that's an important thing to do

I want to design the company’s management and task allocation system based on **object-oriented programming principles**, and I will do it following **Steve Jobs’ management style**, while also **drawing inspiration from Jensen Huang and Elon Musk**.

🔷 Conceptual Core of “ALL IN ONE”

1. Objective

I want to unite multiple AI engineering teams — each with maximum independence but complete alignment toward a shared product ecosystem.
Each team develops an AI model or module, and all modules together form a coherent, integrable system.

This mirrors the OOP philosophy:

	•	Each object (team) is autonomous, encapsulating its internal complexity.
	•	Each object exposes a clear interface (defined points of interaction).
	•	The system architecture defines how these interfaces collaborate under shared rules.

---

2. Philosophical Foundation

Steve Jobs’ method of leading Apple — “no committees, full responsibility, deep collaboration, trust, and unity through shared vision” — perfectly parallels the OOP paradigm in system design.

# Steve Jobs’ Leadership Principle — OOP Equivalent

| **Steve Jobs’ Leadership Principle**                          | **OOP Equivalent**                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Each leader owns one domain (e.g., iPhone hardware, OS, etc.) | Each class/object/module owns one responsibility (**Single Responsibility Principle**) |
| No committees, but constant synchronization                   | No global state, but defined message passing and collaboration                         |
| Trust-based collaboration                                     | Interface-based decoupling                                                             |
| Best ideas win (meritocracy of ideas, not hierarchy)          | **Polymorphism:** behavior decided by the best implementation of a shared interface    |
| Tight unity through shared vision                             | Unified architecture and design patterns                                               |
| Organized like a startup — small teams, high agility          | Modular, loosely coupled, high cohesion components                                     |

3. Meta-Strategy: OOP as an Organizational Operating System

You can think of “ALL IN ONE” as having two levels:
	1.	Code-level OOP → how your AI modules are designed.
	2.	Team-level OOP → how your human teams mirror the same modular principles.

We can formalize this architecture as follows:

🔹 Level 1: Code-Level OOP Architecture

Each team develops a module (AI model, dataset handler, evaluation system, etc.) as a class or subsystem.
These modules interact through well-defined interfaces, abstract base classes, and shared protocols.

🔹 Level 2: Team-Level OOP Architecture

Each team = an object instance in the company’s organization.
	•	Their attributes are their expertise & goals.
	•	Their methods are their internal workflows.
	•	Their interface is how they expose results or collaborate with other teams.
	•	Their inheritance hierarchy comes from your strategic layers — for example, “All vision models inherit from BaseVisionModule.”

 This approach allows the company itself to scale like software — without losing unity — while also creating transparency about which part of the organization is responsible for which part of the code.

4. Strategic Structure for Our Learning Path

Given this, our OOP learning and design path should proceed in three layers — aligned with “ALL IN ONE” philosophy:

Phase 1 — Strategic Layer (Organizational OOP)

We’ll model our organization using OOP and SOLID logic:
	•	Each team’s scope = one class.
	•	Each collaboration = an interface.
	•	Each leadership principle = a design pattern (e.g., Strategy, Observer, Mediator).

Deliverable:
→ A Team Architecture Diagram showing how independence + unity coexist through OOP principles.

---

Phase 2 — System Architecture Layer (Software OOP)
We’ll design the technical structure of the entire “ALL IN ONE” AI system:
	•	Module-level decomposition.
	•	Inter-module communication.
	•	Abstract base classes for interoperability.
	•	SOLID enforcement.
	•	Dependency inversion for flexibility.

Deliverable:
→ A Software Architecture Blueprint, written in OOP UML-like format.

---

Phase 3 — Foundation Layer (Philosophical & Historical)
We’ll trace how OOP evolved as a response to complexity — to clarify why your approach is not just clever but inevitable for large-scale AI ecosystems.

Deliverable:
→ A Conceptual Whitepaper on “OOP as the Architecture of Collaboration,” combining technical, organizational, and philosophical insights.

## **Core Problem (Systemic View)**

A1 must **unite both types of teams** — those working on a _shared goal_ and those pursuing _parallel or tangential goals_ that still share a common technological or methodological foundation.

That duality fundamentally changes how we should design the **OOP-inspired architecture** of A1. Let’s analyze it like a system designer and derive the right structure and strategy layer by layer.

  I want to build a **federated ecosystem** of AI teams:

- Some teams collaborate on the _same product_ (e.g., building an integrated AI system).
    
- Some work on _different products_ but share _infrastructure, methodologies, or goals_ (e.g., reinforcement learning and robotics teams sharing model optimization tools).

So, A1’s architecture must achieve **two simultaneous unities**:

1. **Product unity** → coherence among teams working toward the same output.
    
2. **Platform unity** → coherence among teams that share principles, pipelines, and standards even when their outputs differ.

we need establish the **platform layer** — the _functional foundation_ that thematic products and teams _inherit from, depend on, and build upon_.

So before we divide teams thematically (e.g., Vision, NLP, Robotics), we must first construct a **functional substrate** — a shared set of components, tools, standards, and workflows that define _how things are done_ rather than _what is being built_.

This foundation:

- Provides **unity and interoperability** across all teams.
    
- Prevents **redundant reinvention** (each team doesn’t rebuild its own training or data pipeline).
    
- Creates **transparent rules** for collaboration (so independence doesn’t devolve into incompatibility).

## **Dual-Layer Architecture of A1**


We can now formally define A1 as a **two-layered OOP system**.

### **Layer 1: Functional Foundation (Platform Layer)**

  
Defines _how_ things operate.

It is stable, reusable, and versioned.

All thematic projects must inherit or interface with this layer.


Key domains (example list):

1. **Data Layer**
    
    - Unified data structure & I/O interface.
        
    - Shared dataset formatting, versioning, and loaders.
    
2. **Training Layer**
    
    - Abstract trainer, scheduler, logger, optimizer interface.
    
3. **Evaluation Layer**
    
    - Metrics interface, benchmark registry, performance reporting.
    
4. **Deployment Layer**
    
    - Model serving, packaging, reproducibility tools.
    
5. **Utilities & Common Services**
    
    - Config management, environment setup, resource monitoring.
  

Each of these is a **functional subsystem** (like an abstract class), defining how all A1 modules “speak the same language.”

### **Layer 2: Thematic Applications (Product Layer)**

  

Defines _what_ is being built.

Each team’s project lives here — Vision AI, NLP, RL, Robotics, etc.

They **depend on and extend** the platform layer.
  
This duality ensures:

- **Consistency** through shared structure.
    
- **Freedom** through specialization.

---
## **Strategic Architectural Principle**
  

The right OOP analogue here is **multi-layered modularity** — the same strategy used in operating systems, large AI frameworks (like PyTorch), and distributed multi-agent systems.

We can express A1’s structure using two orthogonal decompositions:

| **Axis**                                    | **OOP Analogy**                      | **Organizational Meaning**                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vertical (Thematic / Product Axis)**      | _Inheritance & Composition_          | Teams working toward a common _end-product_ (e.g., Vision AI pipeline) are structured hierarchically and collaboratively.                                        |
| **Horizontal (Functional / Platform Axis)** | _Interfaces & Abstract Base Classes_ | Teams working on _different_ projects but sharing methodology (e.g., training, evaluation, data handling) are unified through _shared interfaces_ and standards. |

So A1 will have:

- **Vertical unity** for product-level cohesion (e.g., one “project tree” per product).
    
- **Horizontal unity** for cross-team collaboration (shared abstract base standards, tools, libraries, and communication protocols).

Each project = one _object tree_ (composition of submodules).

Each horizontal standard = one _abstract base class_ or _interface_ that defines cross-project rules.

This same architecture maps to human teams:

| **Layer**             | **Purpose**                                 | **Team Type**                                                          | **Autonomy**               | **Coordination**                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Functional Basis**  | Define standards, pipelines, infrastructure | _Core teams_ (platform engineers, MLOps, data engineering, evaluation) | Medium (they define rules) | High — coordinate across projects |
| **Thematic Sections** | Apply foundation to specific AI domains     | _Research & application teams_ (Vision, NLP, RL, Robotics, etc.)       | Very high                  | Light — via interface standards   |

### SOLDI Vs FIRST PRINCIPLE THINKING 

Elon Musk : {don't just follow the trend so you may have heard me say it that it's good to think in terms of the physics approach for first principles which is rather than reasoning by analogy you boil things down to the most fundamental truths you can imagine and you reason up from there and this is a good way to figure out if if something really makes sense or if it's just what everybody else is doing um it's hard to think that way you can't think think that way about everything takes a lot of effort but if you're trying to do something new it's the best way to think and that framework was developed by physicists to figure out counterintuitive things like quantum mechanics so it's really a powerful powerful method}

Thus, thematic teams depend functionally on the foundation but remain strategically independent in their innovations.

However, from an intellectual standpoint, we must always stay ready for paradigm shifts — especially those caused by changes in the fundamental design principles.

I mean the situations where, contrary to the SOLID principles, a single component in the overall design can lead to a complete structural transformation.
  
The main point is this:

In the implementation phase, we must strictly follow SOLID principles;

but in thinking, discussion, and cutting-edge research—where the goal is to reshape or redefine the paradigm—we must not be bound by these principles at all. Absolutely not!

This idea is almost but not exactly the same as saying:

“Central coordination doesn’t depend on any specific team’s internal decisions.”

However, it also includes:

• Continuous consultation and horizontal communication, drawing from the leadership style of Jensen Huang .

• And the understanding that encapsulation must never prevent consultation.
  
Although in SOLID, low-level modules must not depend on high-level ones during implementation, in the design and consultation process, first-principles thinking must flow freely and this flow must be bidirectional. That means a low-level component may inspire a complete architectural redesign at the macro level. Therefore, there must always be intellectual movement between foundations and cutting-edge research, and the system must allow full redesigns and course corrections even mid-way through development.

In short:

• During execution, we avoid coupling.

• But during thinking, consultation, research, and design, we impose no limits.
  
Each part of the system must be able to learn from the others.

Encapsulation applies only in implementation, not in thought or collaboration.

Everyone should be free to access, consult, and learn from any part of the system.

Elon Musk : {when you go through the college you have to answer the question that the professor gives you you don't get to say this is the wrong question and so the first thing you should say is this question is wrong question your constraints it does not matter if the person handing you those constraints will only Nobel Prize even Einstein was wrong some of the time you should actually take the approach that the constraints that you're given are guaranteed to be some degree wrong because the the Counterpoint would be that they are perfect what was it probably this is a platonic idea of a perfect part to zero it's funny which you can properly frame the question the answer is comparatively easy}

## **Transparent Structure & Strategy**

we need _transparency_ — both in structure and in process.

That’s not a management nicety — it’s an **architectural requirement**.
  

In OOP terms:

- Transparency = public interface documentation.
    
- Encapsulation = private internal design.
    
- Harmony = controlled visibility across modules.


Thus, every A1 team should:

1. **Document its public interface** (what it provides, what it requires).
    
2. **Hide internal details** (internal algorithms, model choices).
    
3. **Comply with shared abstract standards** defined at the A1 core level.

  
We can formalize this with an **OOP-inspired organizational contract:**

| **Principle**        | **Software Analogy**                                          | **Team Behavior**                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Encapsulation        | Class hides internal data                                     | Team manages its own methods and tools internally                                                                                             |
| Interface            | Abstract class definition                                     | Team defines input/output expectations                                                                                                        |
| Inheritance          | Subclass from shared base                                     | Teams reuse infrastructure standards                                                                                                          |

| Dependency inversion | Core rules depend on abstract interfaces, not implementations | This is almost/often correct but not exactly/always correct : Central coordination doesn’t depend on any specific team’s internal decisions . |

That’s how we achieve **maximum autonomy** and **maximum unity**

## **Implementation Plan**


To make this real, we’ll need a layered strategy:

1. **Define the A1 Core Layer**
    
    - Contains the “Base Interfaces” (abstract definitions for data, model, training, evaluation, etc.).
        
    - Acts as the “constitution” of A1.
    
2. **Define Project Modules (Vertical Branches)**
    
    - Each corresponds to a product or goal.
        
    - Inherits from A1 Core interfaces.
        
    - Fully autonomous teams.  
    
3. **Define Cross-Functional Services (Horizontal Bridges)**
    
    - Teams maintaining tools, pipelines, or frameworks shared by all.
        
    - Example: unified logging, dataset formatting, training orchestration.
    
4. **Establish Transparent Collaboration Rules**
    
    - Every project publishes its “interface documentation.”

## **Our Programming Approach**
  
We do not have extensive knowledge or experience in Python. At the same time, we are facing a challenging project. Therefore, we must follow these principles:

---

### **Simplicity + High Maintainability and Extensibility**

Since I am not a professional programmer, we need to use **simple code**, but it must be written in a way that is **maintainable and extensible**, allowing future updates and improvements.

---

### **Object-Oriented Design and Modularity**

We must create a library or package that contains the classes, functions, and other components we will use in the main codebase. The goal is to keep the main code clean, concise, and free from scattered complexity. Each part of the system should be designed to be simple, and complex functionality should emerge from the composition of these simple, well-defined modules.

**Each module (or department) must assume that the leaders of other modules do not have sufficient knowledge about its internal details. Therefore, the leaders of each module have three key responsibilities:**

1. **Encapsulation of complexity:** They must keep the complexity of their own module contained within it, preventing unnecessary dependencies and ensuring that collaboration with other modules is as simple and seamless as possible.
    
2. **Sustainable standards:** They must operate according to standards that remain stable over the long term. These standards should be designed so that changes within one module do not affect the functionality of others.
    
3. **Knowledge sharing:** They must actively teach and document how other modules can interact effectively with their module.

---

### **Minimal, Maintainable, and Extensible Initial Version (MVP)**

The system should be **goal-oriented** and **ideal-driven** in its overall design, but **goal-focused**, **minimalist**, and **incremental** in its development process.

Pursuing idealism during the **execution phase** is a **critical mistake**.

**The initial versions must be simple and minimal.** Parts of the program that do not affect the overall functionality may remain incomplete, but they must be written in a **modular and extensible** way so they can be fully developed in later versions.

At the same time, the **core components** of the program must be complete, and the **overall functionality** of the system must be guaranteed — even in the very first version. In other words, although some sections may remain unfinished, the program must still run **fully and reliably**.

After building the initial version, we will **gradually complete the missing parts** of the initial framework **version by version**.

#### **Warning: The overall structure and functionality of minimal versions must still be complete**

**Having minimal code or leaving some sections unfinished does not mean the overall structure can be incomplete.**

Even if some folders or components remain empty for now, the program’s **architecture must be designed properly from the start**, so that it can be **expanded and completed** in later versions.

**In addition to structural completeness, the overall functionality of the program must also be fully operational.**

---

### **Writing Pseudocode Before and During Development**

For every part of the program — including modules — we will **write detailed pseudocode step by step, collaboratively, before starting actual coding**.

Once we reach an agreement on the program’s components, we will begin implementing the real code.

**Writing pseudocode helps us focus on the program’s logic and details without being distracted by syntax.**

It allows us to clarify ambiguous parts and make essential design decisions **before** dealing with implementation details.

Pseudocode is an **important part of the program** itself, so we will **document, maintain, and evolve it** just like the actual source code.

**The pseudocode’s structure must mirror the code’s structure — modular and object-oriented — and it must be stored and organized systematically, as if we were writing the real program.**

---


### توسعه گام به گام
**باید گام به گام و با گام‌هایی کوچک جلو بریم. گام‌هایی کوچک و حداقلی که همگی باید با مشورت من انجام شوند.**

### تست‌های گام به گام
**بعد از هر گام، باید عملکرد بخش نوشته‌شده را تست کنیم.** من تست‌های کوچک را به تست‌های جامع ترجیح می‌دم. در نهایت بعد از اینکه تست‌های کوچک انجام شد و گام به گام جلو رفتیم، تست‌های جامع‌تر نیز انجام خواهیم داد.

### توسعه نسخه به نسخه محافظه‌کارانه
در حین ساخت نسخه حداقلی اول، انتقادات، پیشنهادات و برنامه‌مون برای ساخت نسخه‌های آینده رو داکیومنت خواهیم کرد.  
بعد از پایان توسعه ورژن حداقلی (اما با عملکرد صحیح) و انجام تست‌های لازم و راضی بودن از نتیجه، نوبت به توسعه بیشتر سیستم خواهد رسید. در این مرحله هم محافظه‌کارانه جلو خواهیم رفت و تمام تغییرات و پیشرفت‌های دلخواهمون رو در یک مرحله پیاده‌سازی نخواهیم کرد. بلکه ورژن به ورژن، با گام‌هایی کوچک، در هر نسخه، بهبودهایی ایجاد می‌کنیم یا برنامه رو گسترش می‌دیم. بعد از تست کردن تغییرات و راضی بودن از عملکرد، به سراغ نسخه‌های بعدی و بعدی خواهیم رفت.

## شروع مسیر برنامه‌نویسی

**گام به گام جلو بریم. بدون مشورت کردن با من نباید کاری انجام بشه. هر کاری هم که می‌خوای انجام بدی باید توضیح بدی. من نظرات، پیشنهادات، اهداف و برنامه‌ام رو شرح دادم. هر جا که به نظرت مبهمه، می‌تونیم صحبت کنیم.**  
می‌تونیم روی شبه‌کد مشورت کنیم، اسکلت اولیه پروژه رو شکل بدیم و ماژول‌ها، فایل‌ها و ساختار کلی برنامه رو اصلاح کنیم و ... . اصلاح و مشورت خوبه اما خودسر حق نداری هیچ کدوم از این‌ها رو تغییر بدی.

## زبان و ابزارها

- **زبان برنامه‌نویسی**:Python
- **فریم ورک اصلی**: PyTorch
-  **دیتابیس**: فایل‌های JSON
- **محیط کاربری**: Command Line Interface (CLI)
- **ذخیره‌ی فایل‌ها**: PDF، JPG در پوشه‌های مربوطه، مسیرشان در JSON نگهداری می‌شود.
- **برای ذخیره داده باید از فرمت داده JSON استفاده کرد، کلیه فایل‌های دیگر نیز (PDF، تصاویر و ...) باید در فولدر مربوطه ذخیره شود و مسیر آن‌ها در صورت نیاز در فایل‌های JSON جایگذاری شوند.**

==+‌ استفاده بسیار بالا از فرصت ها ، امکانات و پروژه های اوپن سورس== 

### بخش اول: اسکلت اولیه و ساختار کلی برنامه

این اسکلت اولیه می تواند الهام بخش باشد . البته نیاز به اصلاح و گسترش دارد که باید با هم مشورت کنیم .

### بخش دوم: فایل‌های JSON و ارتباطشان با برخی کلاس‌ها
.........
........
.......

#### هشدار
- **از سخت‌کُد کردن داده‌ها اجتناب کن.**
- **پروژه باید portable باشه.**
- **اصل Single Source of Truth رعایت شود.**

#### مدیریت فایل‌ها
- **برای ذخیره داده باید از فرمت داده JSON استفاده کرد، کلیه فایل‌های دیگر نیز (PDF، تصاویر و ...) باید در فولدر مربوطه ذخیره شود و مسیر آن‌ها در صورت نیاز در فایل‌های JSON جایگذاری شوند.**  
- **نکته مهم: نام فایل‌ها شامل `student_code` و `course_title` باشد تا یکتا شوند.**

### بخش سوم: توسعه (  MVP ها و پکیج اصلی + پکیج سطح پایین)

در بخش اول به ساخت **MVP** خواهیم پرداخت. منظور از **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** یک **نسخه حداقلی و کاربردی** از کل برنامه است که:
- باید **قابل اجرا و عملیاتی** باشد (نه فقط یک سری ماژول خام).
- دارای ساختاری **آینده‌نگرانه و قابل توسعه** باشد.
- هرچند بسیاری از بخش‌ها هنوز کامل نشده‌اند، اما در همین نسخه باید برنامه به‌طور کامل کار کند.

در گام اول این مرحله، باید تعیین کنیم که چه بخش‌هایی رو تا چه حد پیش خواهیم رفت، چگونه انجامش خواهیم داد. همچنین تعیین کنیم که چه بخش‌هایی به نسخه‌های بعد موکول خواهد شد.

#### ویژگی‌های کلیدی MVP
حتی اولین نسخه حداقلی (MVP) نیز باید:
- **کدی تمیز و خوانا** داشته باشد.
- دارای **کامنت‌گذاری درست و توضیحات شفاف** باشد.
- **ساختاری آینده‌نگرانه** داشته باشد، یعنی طوری طراحی شود که توسعه در نسخه‌های بعدی بدون بازنویسی کامل امکان‌پذیر باشد.
- شامل فایل‌ها و پوشه‌هایی باشد که بعضی از آن‌ها ممکن است در این مرحله خالی بمانند، اما جایگاهشان از همین ابتدا مشخص است.

**مهم است که تأکید کنیم: MVP صرفاً یک اسکلت ناقص نیست؛ بلکه یک نسخه واقعی و کاربردی از برنامه است که می‌تواند اجرا شود و نیازهای پایه‌ای را برطرف کند.**  
**یک کد قابل استفاده اما بدون اسکلت‌بندی هم نیست. اتفاقا توجه ویژه‌ای به اسکلت قابل رشد و توسعه دارد.**

#### اصول طراحی در هر MVP

به‌طور خلاصه MVP ما باید از نظر امکانات، پیچیدگی و تعداد خطوط کد، حداقلی باشد در عین حال عملکرد کامل داشته باشد (گرچه با امکانات کم) اما قابل توسعه و ساختارمند باشد و اسکلت قوی داشته باشد. برای اینکه MVP هم **کار کند** و هم **قابل توسعه** باشد، از **برنامه‌نویسی شی‌گرا (OOP)** و **طراحی ماژولار** استفاده خواهیم کرد و قبل از نوشتن `main_program`، به ساخت پکیج‌های لازم خواهیم پرداخت.

- **بخش‌ها باید تا جای ممکن تک‌وظیفه‌ای طراحی شوند.** (حتی اگر یک ماژول وظیفه پیچیده‌ای داره باید حداقلی و کوچک بنویسیمش!! این کار رو با این استراتژی انجام خواهیم داد: وظیفه اصلی رو به بخش‌های کوچکتر تقسیم می‌کنیم و برای هر کدام از این بخش‌ها، یک ماژول می‌سازیم، با این کار می‌تونیم ماژول پیچیده رو ساده کنیم و به جای اینکه یک کد طولانی بنویسیم، از ماژول‌هایی که ساختیم برای ساخت این ماژول پیچیده‌تر استفاده کنیم. مثلا چند تابع رو صدا بزنیم. به‌طور کلی سعی ما بر اینه که بخش‌ها کوچک و تک‌وظیفه‌ای باشند یا حداقل وظایف رو داشته باشند. در عوض برای اجرا قسمت‌های پیچیده، یک تابع می‌تونه توابع دیگه رو صدا بزنه و ...)
fin
- **ماژول‌ها باید کوچک و قابل تست باشند. قابل تست بودن هم مهمه. حتی اگر تست ننویسیم.**
- این MVP باید علاوه بر داشتن **پکیج‌ها**، یک **برنامه اصلی (Main Program / Application Layer)** هم داشته باشد که از این پکیج استفاده کرده و خروجی عملی و قابل مشاهده تولید کند.

#### ساختار MVP ها 
MVP شامل سه جزء اصلی است:
1. **پکیج اصلی (Core package)**:
   - شامل کلاس‌ها و توابع مرتبط با منطق اصلی پروژه.
2. **پکیج سطح پایین (Utility/Tools package)**:
   - شامل ابزارها و توابع عمومی قابل استفاده مجدد، که هم در Core و هم در سایر بخش‌ها به کار می‌آیند.
3. **برنامه اصلی (Main Program / Application Layer)**:
   - بخشی که با استفاده از Core و Utility یک نسخه حداقلی و کاربردی از سیستم را اجرا می‌کند.
   - این بخش همان چیزی است که MVP را تبدیل به یک **برنامه واقعی و قابل اجرا** می‌کند.

🔑 بنابراین:
- **پکیج‌ها = زیرساخت و ستون فقرات MVP**
- **برنامه اصلی = MVP را به یک محصول کاربردی و عملیاتی تبدیل می‌کند**

## جزئیات ساختار و عملکرد MVP

این بخش رو کامل ننوشتم. قراره با هم کاملش کنیم.
